                                    <p>The common practice is to <span class="text-info">fast</span> from dawn to sunset. The pre-dawn meal before the
                                        fast is called the suhur, while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is
                                        called iftar.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Muslims devote more time to prayer and acts of charity, striving to improve their
                                        self-discipline, motivated by hadith:[59][60] "When Ramadan arrives, the gates
                                        of Paradise are opened and the gates of hell are locked up and devils are put in
                                        chains.</p>

                                    <h4 class="text-info"><i>1. Reduce the amount of bad cholestrol </i></h4>
                                    <p> While fasting is tough, the good news is it appears to be good for your health.
                                        For starters, there's some evidence that fasting can reduce the amount of "bad"
                                        cholesterol in the blood stream and increase the amount of "good" cholesterol,
                                        which can reduce the risk of heart disease.</p>

                                    <h4 class="text-info"><i>2. Boost your brain </i></h4>
                                    <p>No doubt you’ll be aware of the positive effects fasting can have on your mental
                                        wellbeing and spiritual focus, but the brain-boosting powers of Ramadan are even
                                        more significant than you might think. A study carried out by scientists in the
                                        USA found that the mental focus achieved during Ramadan increases the level of
                                        brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which causes the body to produce more brain
                                        cells, thus improving brain function.
                                        <br>
                                        Likewise, a distinct reduction in the amount of the hormone cortisol, produced
                                        by the adrenal gland, means that stress levels are greatly reduced both during
                                        and after Ramadan.</p>

                                    <h4 class="text-info"><i>3. Ditch bad habits </i></h4>
                                    <p>Because you will be fasting during the day, Ramadan is the perfect time to ditch
                                        your bad habits for good. Vices such as smoking and sugary foods should not be
                                        indulged during Ramadan, and as you abstain from them your body will gradually
                                        acclimatise to their absence, until your addiction is kicked for good.
                                        <br>
                                        It’s also much easier to quit habits when you do so in a group, which should be
                                        easy to find during Ramadan. Fasting’s ability to help you cut out bad habits is
                                        so significant that the UK’s National Health Service recommends it as the ideal
                                        time to ditch smoking.</p>

                                    <h4 class="text-info"><i>4. Lasting appetite reduction </i></h4>
                                    <p>One of the main problems with extreme fad diets is that any weight lost is often
                                        quickly put back on, sometimes even with a little added extra. This isn’t the
                                        case with Ramadan. The reduction in food consumed throughout fasting causes your
                                        stomach to gradually shrink, meaning you’ll need to eat less food to feel full.
                                        <br>
                                        If you want to get into the habit of healthy eating then Ramadan is a great time
                                        to start. When it’s finished your appetite will be lower than it was before, and
                                        you’ll be far less likely to overindulge with your eating.</p>

                                    <h4 class="text-info"><i>5. Detoxify </i></h4>
                                    <p>As well as being great for spiritually cleansing yourself, Ramadan acts as a
                                        fantastic detox for your body. By not eating or drinking throughout the day your
                                        body will be offered the rare chance to detoxify your digestive system
                                        throughout the month.

                                        When your body starts eating into fat reserves to create energy, it will also
                                        burn away any harmful toxins that might be present in fat deposits. This body
                                        cleanse will leave a healthy blank slate behind, and is the perfect stepping
                                        stone to a consistently healthy lifestyle.</p>

                                    <h4 class="text-info"><i>6. Absorb more nutrients </i></h4>
                                    <p>By not eating throughout the day during Ramadan you’ll find that your metabolism
                                        becomes more efficient, meaning the amount of nutrients you absorb from food
                                        improves. This is because of an increase in a hormone called adiponectin, which
                                        is produced by a combination of fasting and eating late at night, and allows
                                        your muscles to absorb more nutrients.
                                        <br>
                                        This will lead to health benefits all around the body, as various areas are able
                                        to better absorb and make use of the nutrients they need to function.</p>
